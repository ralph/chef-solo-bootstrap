= DESCRIPTION:

Uses the Chef configuration management tool, specifically chef-solo to
configure a remote server. This is the simplest way to get started with
using Chef.

= REQUIREMENTS:

* Adjust your ~/.ssh/config like the example in the ssh_config file. You
  will have to adjust the location of the identity file.
* Make sure Chef is installed on the remote server you want to
  configure. See chef_bootstrap_amazon_linux_ami.sh to help.
* Modify config/chef.json to specify the recipes from the 'cookbooks'
  dir you want to run
* Run with 'rake cook server=host.domain.com'

= HOW IT WORKS:

When you run the 'rake cook' task it will:

* rsync this entire directory to the location specified in
  'REMOTE_CHEF_PATH' in the Rakefile
* Run chef-solo on the remote machine using the config files in config/
  and your cookbooks.
* Run the 'test' recipe which creates the dir '/tmp/foobarbaz' on the
  remote machine.
* Sprinkles magic dust on your server...

Just updated to match my understanding of the most recent config. My
thanks to the author for giving me an excellent headstart.
